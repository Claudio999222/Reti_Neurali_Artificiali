# MNIST Image Recognition with Neural Networks

This notebook demonstrates the creation and training of a neural network model using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) and is commonly used for image classification tasks. In this notebook, we'll utilize the Keras library to build and train a neural network for recognizing the digits in the MNIST dataset.

## Key Steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the MNIST dataset, which includes training and testing sets.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize the pixel values, reshape the images, and one-hot encode the labels.

3. **Model Architecture**: Define the architecture of the neural network, specifying the layers and activation functions.

4. **Model Compilation**: Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

5. **Model Training**: Train the neural network on the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the test data to assess its accuracy.

This notebook serves as a practical example of using neural networks for image recognition tasks, providing insights into the model's performance on the MNIST dataset.
